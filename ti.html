        <p>Hi there! my name is Nathaniel Gumban, and I am currently a Grade 9 student
            at Las Pi√±as City National Science High School. Being a student of this school 
            has been an exciting journey full of challenges and opportunities for growth.</p>
        <p>I enjoy learning about different subjects, including economics, literature, and 
            information and communication technology (ICT). While my journey at LPSci is not without its challenges, 
            such as improving my English-speaking skills, I am determined to continue growing academically 
            and personally.</p>
        <p>Outside of school, I like to explore different genres of literature and learn more about 
            Filipino language and culture. My time at LPSci has been both rewarding and motivating, 
            and I am excited for what the future holds!</p>
